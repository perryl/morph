NEWS for Morph
==============

This file contains high-level summaries of what's changed in each release.

Version 13, released 2014-NO-IDEA
-------------------------------

* Code reduction through the use of pyfilesystem objects.
* Added support fo ppc64 architecture (POWER PC 64-bit)
* morph build and morph deploy will now strip .morph extensions from arguments
* The build and deploy subcommands' implementations were reworked to aid
  comprehensibility, the old implementation for build is still available as
  old-build, but there is no old-deploy.
* The test suite prints error messages during scenario tests to the terminal
  more often, run faster tests before slower ones, and correctly returns
  failure when inspecting files for style errors.
* GitDirectory was extended to have .get_index([name]) and .get_remote(name)
  methods, which return GitIndex and GitRemote objects. GitIndex is for
  querying the status of the working tree, or adding files to the index.
  GitRemote is mostly about pushing refspecs, but can also query and set
  push/pull urls.
* LocalRefManager and RemoteRefManager are built on the GitDirectory classes
  and allow transactional updating of refs, so you can rollback if an update
  fails, or a build fails with the updated refs.
* BuildBranch is built on top of those and the SystemBranchDirectory class to
  tie a bunch of changes that come from a workspace and manage pushing,
  rolling back and using the right repository+ref when building.

Version 12, released 2013-11-15
-------------------------------

* NEWS file added.
