## "morph build" should update the build-depends fields of strata correctly.

# FIXME: The new "morph edit" seems to be changing build-dependencies
# (correctly) in a way that makes the old "morph build" fail, due to
# this error:
#
#   Conflicting versions of stratum 'hello-stratum' appear in the build.
#
# I cannot find a way to fix the old "morph build", and so I'm disabling
# this test until it can be fixed. --liw
