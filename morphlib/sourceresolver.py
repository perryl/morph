class SourceResolver(object):
    '''Provides a way of resolving the set of sources for a given system.

    There are three levels of caching involved in resolving the sources to
    build.

    The canonical repo for each source is specified in the build-command
    (for strata and systems) or in the stratum morphology (for chunks). It will
    be either a normal URL, or a keyed URL using a repo-alias like
    'baserock:baserock/definitions'.

    Each commit used in a build is resolved to a tree SHA1, which means that
    merge commits and changes to commit messages don't affect the cache
    identity of a chunk. This does mean we need to query every repo in the
    build graph, though.

    All requests for information on a repo use the 'repocache' module. This
    maintains a local copy of all the Git repos we need to work with. A repo
    cache can also use a remote 'morph-cache-server' instance, if available,
    to query certain information about a repo without cloning it locally.
    Using this we can resolve commits to trees without having to clone every
    repo locally, which is a huge performance improvement in some cases.

    The third layer of caching is a simple commit SHA1 -> tree SHA mapping. It
    turns out that even if all repos are available locally, running
    'git rev-parse' on hundreds of repos requires a lot of IO and can take
    several minutes. Likewise, on a slow network connection it is time
    consuming to keep querying the remote repo cache. This third layer of
    caching works around both of those issues.

    The need for 3 levels of caching highlights design inconsistencies in
    Baserock, but for now it is worth the effort to maintain this code to save
    users from waiting 7 minutes each time that they want to build. The level 3
    cache is fairly simple because commits are immutable, so there is no danger
    of this cache being stale as long as it is indexed by commit SHA1. Due to
    the policy in Baserock of always using a commit SHA1 (rather than a named
    ref) in the system definitions, it makes repeated builds of a system very
    fast as no resolution needs to be done at all.

    Note that Git submodules are not considered 'sources' in the current
