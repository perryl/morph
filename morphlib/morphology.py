class Morphology(UserDict.IterableUserDict):

    '''A container for a morphology, plus its metadata.

    A morphology is, basically, a dict. This class acts as that dict,
    plus stores additional metadata about the morphology, such as where
    it came from, and the ref that was used for it. It also has a dirty
    attribute, to indicate whether the morphology has had changes done
    to it, but does not itself set that attribute: the caller has to
    maintain the flag themselves.

    This class does NO validation of the data, nor does it parse the
    morphology text, or produce a textual form of itself. For those
    things, see MorphologyLoader.
