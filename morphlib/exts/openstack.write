'''A Morph deployment write extension for deploying to OpenStack.'''

class OpenStackWriteExtension(morphlib.writeexts.WriteExtension):

    '''Configure a raw disk image into an OpenStack host.

    The raw disk image is created during Morph's deployment and the
    image is deployed in OpenStack using python-glanceclient.
    
    The location command line argument is the authentification url
    of the OpenStack server using the following syntax:
 
    http://HOST:PORT/VERSION

    where

    * HOST is the host running OpenStack
    * PORT is the port which is using OpenStack for authentifications.
    * VERSION is the authentification version of OpenStack (Only v2.0
      supported)

    This extension needs in the environment the following variables:
 
    * OPENSTACK_USER is the username to use in the deployment.
    * OPENSTACK_TENANT is the project name to use in the deployment.
    * OPENSTACK_IMAGENAME is the name of the image to create.
    * OPENSTACK_PASSWORD is the password of the user.
        

    The extension will connect to OpenStack using python-glanceclient
    to configure a raw image.
